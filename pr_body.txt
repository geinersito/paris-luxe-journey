## DOCS-PLAN-RECON-01 — P0/R0: Reconcile legacy backlog into canonical SSOT

### Summary
Docs-only PR that migrates 17 legacy items from PLAN_VIVO_MEJORAS_UI.md into the canonical SSOT (docs/plan/IMPROVEMENTS.md) with proper IDs and reconciles DONE vs TODO status.

### Changes
- **docs/plan/IMPROVEMENTS.md**: Added 17 migrated items with canonical IDs (NAV-AIRPORTS-01, UX-EXCURSIONS-QUOTEFIRST-01, etc.)
- **docs/PLAN_VIVO_MEJORAS_UI.md**: Added legacy → canonical mapping section and updated legacy table with DONE evidence
- **docs/STATUS.md**: Updated "Next 3" with prioritized items from reconciled backlog

### Reconciliation Findings
**Already DONE (backfilled evidence)**:
- NAV-AIRPORTS-01 (PR-U1b): `7c9bc64` - Full airport landings (CDG/Orly/Beauvais)
- UX-EXCURSIONS-QUOTEFIRST-01 (PR-U1d): `7168baa` - Quote-first CTAs (no booking leakage)
- UX-EXCURSIONS-CURATION-01 (PR-U1h): `7168baa` - Curation pass
- UX-HEADER-I18N-01 covered PR-U1k and PR-U1l (already tracked as #41 `e40d506`)

**TODO items**: 13 remaining (see IMPROVEMENTS.md for full list)

### Gates (docs-only)
- [x] No code changes
- [x] Links verified

### Next Action
