    content: `# How to Avoid Taxi Scams at Paris Airports

## Common Taxi Scams in Paris

Unfortunately, taxi scams targeting tourists are common at Paris airports. Here's what to watch out for:

### 1. Unlicensed "Taxis"

**The Scam:**
Men approach you in the arrivals hall offering "taxi" services. They're not licensed and will overcharge dramatically.

**How to Avoid:**
- **Never** accept rides from people approaching you inside the terminal
- Only use official taxi stands outside
- Look for licensed taxis with roof lights and meters

### 2. Broken Meter Scam

**The Scam:**
Driver claims the meter is broken and quotes an inflated flat rate.

**How to Avoid:**
- Insist on the meter being used
- Know the approximate fare beforehand
- If meter is truly broken, find another taxi

### 3. Long Route Scam

**The Scam:**
Driver takes unnecessarily long routes to increase the fare.

**How to Avoid:**
- Use Google Maps to follow the route
- Know the approximate distance and time
- Speak up if the route seems wrong

### 4. Credit Card "Problems"

**The Scam:**
Driver claims card machine is broken, forcing you to pay cash (often more than the meter shows).

**How to Avoid:**
- Ask about card payment before getting in
- Have some cash as backup
- Get a receipt showing the amount paid

## Official Taxi Rates from Paris Airports

### From CDG Airport
- **Right Bank:** €50 flat rate
- **Left Bank:** €55 flat rate
- **Supplements:** €4 for 4th passenger, €1 per large bag

### From Orly Airport
- **Right Bank:** €35 flat rate
- **Left Bank:** €30 flat rate
- **Same supplements apply**

## The Safer Alternative: Pre-Booked Private Transfer

### Why Pre-Book?

1. **Fixed price** agreed in advance
2. **No meter games** or route scams
3. **Driver waits for you** with name sign
4. **Flight tracking** - no rush if delayed
5. **Professional service** - vetted drivers
6. **English-speaking** drivers available

### What You Get

- Meet & greet at arrivals
- Help with luggage
- Luxury vehicle (Mercedes E-Class or similar)
- Bottled water
- Phone chargers
- Child seats available

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 Someone approaches you inside the terminal
🚩 No visible taxi license or meter
🚩 Driver refuses to use the meter
🚩 Price quoted before journey starts
🚩 Driver insists on cash only
🚩 Vehicle is unmarked or looks unofficial
🚩 Driver is aggressive or pushy

## What to Do If Scammed

1. **Take photos** of the vehicle and license plate
2. **Get a receipt** with driver details
3. **Report to airport police** immediately
4. **File complaint** with Paris taxi authority
5. **Contact your credit card** company if overcharged

## Our Recommendation

For peace of mind and guaranteed fair pricing, book a private transfer in advance. You'll pay a fixed rate (usually comparable to or only slightly more than a taxi) and avoid all the stress and scam risks.

**CDG to Paris:** €65-75
**Orly to Paris:** €55-65
**Beauvais to Paris:** €140-160
