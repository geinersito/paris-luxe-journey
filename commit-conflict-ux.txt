fix(fn+ui): handle DB conflict with dedicated UX

Backend:
- Replace generic catch with errorResponse() for structured errors
- Always return {ok, code, dbCode, message, details}

Frontend (Payment.tsx):
- Add conflictError state
- Detect 23P01/23505/CONFLICT in handleSubmit
- Show dedicated UI with AlertCircle + actions:
  - Back to Details (change slot)
  - Retry (same booking)

DoD R1:
- TypeScript OK
- User no longer stuck on payment page when conflict
- Clear messaging + actionable buttons
